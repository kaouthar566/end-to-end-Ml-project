### context
####Retail banks and financial institutions face significant challenges in managing credit risk. A major portion of their revenue comes from interest earned on loans, particularly home loans and personal loans. However, defaults on these loans, also known as non-performing loans (NPLs), can severely impact profitability and liquidity. Traditional credit assessment methods often rely on manual evaluation and historical credit scoring, which may be time-consuming, error-prone, and unable to capture complex patterns in borrower behavior. With the increasing availability of digital financial data, there is an opportunity to leverage machine learning models to improve loan risk assessment and decision-making.
